## Baselines

There are code for our main baseline K-NRM and Conv-KNRM:

- [End-to-end neural ad-hoc ranking with kernel pooling](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/cx/www/papers/K-NRM.pdf)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks for Soft-Matching N-Grams in Ad-hoc Search](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhuyund/papers/WSDM_2018_Dai.pdf)


## EDRM

There are codes for our work based on Conv-KNRM.


## Results

The ranking results. All results are in trec format.
