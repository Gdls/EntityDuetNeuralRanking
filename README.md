# EntityDuetNeuralRanking
There are source codes for Entity-Duet Neural Ranking Model (EDRM)

## Baselines

There are our main baseline K-NRM and Conv-KNRM:

- [End-to-end neural ad-hoc ranking with kernel pooling](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/cx/www/papers/K-NRM.pdf)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks for Soft-Matching N-Grams in Ad-hoc Search](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhuyund/papers/WSDM_2018_Dai.pdf)

The Sogou query not is not published, so we release the codes with two published question-answering data sets.


## EDRM

There are codes for our work. And the same experimnts parameters can be found in K-NRM paper.


## Results

The ranking results. All results are in trec format.
